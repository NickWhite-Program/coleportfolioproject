<p>For this project, we were tasked with creating a html website that featured some sort of story, and the story for mine was about the trees that can be found in North America and beyond. The website features a table with several different trees, including Oak and Douglas Firs. https://nickwhite-program.github.io/coleproject2025/index.html</p>
